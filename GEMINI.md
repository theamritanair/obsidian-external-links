# Gemini Code Review: Obsidian External Links Plugin

## Project Summary

The "Obsidian External Links" plugin is a utility for the Obsidian note-taking application. It provides a dedicated view in the sidebar that lists all external links found within the user's vault. The links are grouped by the note in which they appear, making it easy to see the context of each link. This plugin is useful for users who want to manage and review their external references in one centralized location.

## Technical Overview

*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Obsidian API:** The plugin is built on top of the official Obsidian API.
*   **Build Tool:** Uses `esbuild` for fast TypeScript compilation.
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   `obsidian`: The core Obsidian API types.
    *   `typescript`: For static typing.
    *   `esbuild`: For building the plugin.
*   **Core Logic (`main.ts`):**
    *   `ExternalLinksPlugin`: The main plugin class that handles initialization, settings, and commands. It now also manages a cache of external links to optimize performance.
    *   `ExternalLinksView`: An `ItemView` that creates the custom sidebar view. It is a stateless component that renders the list of external links from the cache provided by the `ExternalLinksPlugin`.
    *   `ExternalLinksSettingTab`: A `PluginSettingTab` that provides the user interface for configuring the plugin's settings.
    *   **Caching:**
        *   The plugin maintains a cache of all external links in the vault, stored in the `data.json` file in the plugin's configuration directory (via `saveData` and `loadData`).
        *   On startup, the cache is loaded from storage, and a full scan of the vault is performed to ensure the cache is up-to-date.
        *   The plugin listens for file system events (`create`, `modify`, `delete`, `rename`) to update the cache in real-time.
        *   The cache is saved to disk only when the plugin is unloaded, minimizing disk I/O.
    *   **Link Extraction:** The `extractExternalLinks` method uses two regular expressions to find links: one for Markdown-style links (`[text](url)`) and another for plain URLs in the text.
